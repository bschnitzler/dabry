# schnitzler-thesis-notebooks
Jupyter (Python) notebooks used to generate the results for B. Schnitzler's PhD thesis.

The notebooks require `dabry` to be installed, in the version used for the thesis ("PhD thesis version" release).

The notebooks are given for information in an open-source effort. Some parts of them may need to be adapted for the code to work.
