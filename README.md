## Mermoz path planning problem analysis

### Presentation

This module helps get insight into the Mermoz path planning problem.

It comes up with a model of the situation and wind conditions that enables
definition of arbitrary windfields from base potential flow elements.

The reachability analysis is performed on the augmented system with
adjoint state. 
Candidate time-optimal trajectories can be computed and plotted.
Explicit feedback control laws can also be defined and corresponding
trajectories can be integrated and plotted.

### Run examples

Running examples `example1.py` and `example2.py` are provided in the `src` folder.
